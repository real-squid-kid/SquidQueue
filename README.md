# RaffleRaffle
An open-source raffle tickets printing program. Branched from SquidQueue, written on VB.NET

Fresh binaries are always in /bin/Debug. Make sure to grab the entire folder, especially the .dll. <br/>


## Register
Press "Register" to register (and print) another ticket. You can print the exact ticket without adding it to the base.<br/>
OR you can enable automatic listening to changes on Internet page to print out tickets. Good for registration forms.

## System Settings
Here you can set up the printer name (should be like the name mentioned in "Printers and Scanners"), test how the font will look and add a logo to your tickets.<br/>
